- **Document Upload and Processing**: Supports uploading and processing documents in PDF format, incorporating them into the system for future retrieval and analysis.
- **Document Retrieval**: Enables querying of documents by IDs, allowing for efficient data retrieval.
- **Conversational Interface**: Facilitates the creation and management of conversations, along with quick response generation for interactive applications.
- **Advanced Text Analysis**: Utilizes vector databases for semantic search and retrieval, enhancing the application's ability to understand and process natural language queries.
## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

The application requires specific environment variables for its operation, including configurations for Auth0, database URLs, and API keys. These variables should be defined in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```ini
# .env example configuration
AUTH0_DOMAIN=
AUTH0_API_AUDIENCE=
AUTH0_ISSUER=
AUTH0_ALGORITHMS=
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@convo-db:5432/postgres
DATABASE_URL2=postgresql+psycopg2://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase
collection_name=
```

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the application and its dependencies, including the FastAPI service and PostgreSQL databases. Use the following commands to manage your Docker environment:

- **Start the Application**: `docker-compose up --build`
- **Build Images**: `docker-compose build`

### API Endpoints

The application provides a set of RESTful endpoints for document management and conversation processing, accessible through FastAPI's interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` or `http://localhost:8000/redoc`.

## Directory Structure

A brief overview of the project's directory structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Main FastAPI application
â”œâ”€â”€ appfrwk/                # Common framework code
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                    # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ setup.py                # Python package setup
```

## Conclusion

The RAG Application stands at the intersection of document processing and conversational AI, providing a versatile platform for developing advanced text analysis and interaction solutions. By leveraging Docker, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, it offers a scalable and efficient infrastructure for a wide range of applications.
